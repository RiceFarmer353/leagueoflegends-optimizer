# Improving the model

As we've seen in practice, the accuracy of our model (currently 51%) couldn't be worse (it's almost as if our model was making random predictions every time). We can improve it by adding more variables to our model. We're going to create a model that considers all variables in our **matchup** data structure, and reduce the complexity of our ML code by using AutoML open-source tools for data exploration and model training.

## Using pandas_profiling

By importing and using **`pandas_profiling`**, we get detailed, graphical insights into our dataset.

```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport
df = pd.read_csv('matchups.csv')
report = ProfileReport(df)
report
```

TODO IMG

This simple code generates a dynamic report that shows the data types, missing values, and other information about the data. We explore the Pearson's r correlation coefficient between the variables:

![Visualization of Pearson's r data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/leagueoflegends-optimizer/blob/main/images/a3-pearson.PNG?raw=true)


We proceed to train our model with all variables, taking into consideration that most of the variables in our model are highly correlated. This is especially true for the amount of gold earned with respect to the number of kills and minions killed (which makes sense, as these are two of the actions that give out the most gold in-game). We also see that the vision score highly correlates with the amount of assists a player makes in a game.

```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor, TabularDataset
# train-test split
df = TabularDataset('matchups.csv')

train = df.sample(frac=0.8, random_state=200)
test = df.drop(train.index)

# a simple look into our data
df.head(2)
```

We determine our predicting feature and fit the model:

```python
label = 'WIN'

save_path = './trained_models'  # specifies folder to store trained models
predictor = TabularPredictor(label=label, path=save_path).fit(train)
```

We can now make predictions on our test data:

```python
y_test = test[label]  # predict 'WIN'
test_data_nolabel = test.drop(columns=[label]) 
test_data_nolabel.head()

predictor = TabularPredictor.load(save_path)
y_pred = predictor.predict(test_data_nolabel)
print("Predictions:  \n", y_pred)
perf = predictor.evaluate_predictions(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred, auxiliary_metrics=True)
```

We can see some sample predictions by our model on the test data.

| 4 | False |
| 8 | False |

And with all trained models, we create a leaderboard with descending accuracy:

```python
predictor.leaderboard(test, silent=True)
```

As we can see, including more variables in the model greatly improved the accuracy and reduced MAE and MSE of our model. We can also see that the model is able to predict the outcome of the game in the test data given the features in our data structure. This proves that a simple model is not always the best solution. We can achieve better results by using more advanced models, in this case about 83% accuracy, which is pretty good for a real-world problem.

Also, note that we don't really care how the models are trained as long as they make good predictions. Of course, it's important to know the basics of ML to see how data is structured, but I'd like you, as a reader, to finish reading this article and remember that the hardest part about data science and data engineering is not coding the ML model, but understanding the data and the problem, and structuring the data accordingly to satisfy our needs.

## The Problem and Next Steps

In short, in the first model, we didn't consider enough variables. The results of this ML model were no better than using simple statistics, and heavily relied on additional statistics support to make a bit more sense.

After expanding the model further, we saw that the model could make predictions much more accurately. However, we needed to ask ourselves if this model is useful. Are we, as players of League of Legends, able to have this amount of data in the middle of a game? The answer is **no**. We're just given simple statistics like the gold from the team and KDA ratio. Only programatically through the API do we have the possibility to access all this data. So, while the model is pretty good, it doesn't have a practical side that we can use and take advantage of. This is what we'll explore in the fourth article in this series: integrating such a model (or a similar one) with data that we can actually use in real-time to make accurate predictions; data aligned with what players have at hand. Stay tuned for article 4!
